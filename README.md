# TidyTuesday Data Visualization

Every week I will work on a data set released by TidyTuesday ([link](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)) by 
processing it, visualizing it and applying some models on it. 


This is a very fun project, and it is very enjoyable to analyze 
data and understand data from various fields. After finishing 
data visualization, I always tweet the work and share the visualizations
with the Tidyverse community. You can check out my Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/PursuitOfDS).
