# TidyTuesday Data Visualization

On every Tuesday I work on a data set released by TidyTuesday ([link](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)) by
processing and then visualizing it. 

This is a very fun project, and it is rather gratifying to analyze 
data and understand data in this fashion. After generating 
plots by using ggplot2, I will always tweet the work and share the visualizations
with the Tidyverse community. You can check out my Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/PursuitOfDS).
